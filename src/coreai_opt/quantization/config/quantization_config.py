class QATSchedule(BaseModel):
    """Schedule for controlling observer and fake quantization state in QAT.

    Defines step thresholds for enabling/disabling observers and fake quantization
    during quantization-aware training. Must be used in conjunction with the
    ``quantizer.step()`` API to advance the schedule.

    The step values correspond to the cadence at which ``quantizer.step()`` is
    called. For example, if ``step()`` is called once per batch, the thresholds
    represent batch steps; if called once per epoch, they represent epochs.

    Calling ``step()`` increments the step counter and immediately applies
    the corresponding observer/fake-quantization state. Where you place
    ``step()`` in your training loop determines when the model sees the
    new state.

    Attributes:
        enable_observer: Step count at which observers are enabled. Must be >= 0.
        enable_fake_quant: Step count at which fake quantization is enabled.
            Must be >= enable_observer.
        disable_observer: Step count at which observers are disabled. Must be
            > enable_observer and >= enable_fake_quant if provided. None means
            observers are never disabled by the schedule.

    Example:
        >>> schedule = QATSchedule(
        ...     enable_observer=0,
        ...     enable_fake_quant=500,
        ...     disable_observer=1500,
        ... )

    Note:
        In graph execution mode, when consecutive modules both quantize the
        intermediate edge (one via ``op_output_spec``, the next via
        ``op_input_spec``), graph mode deduplicates them into a single
        fake-quantize node. The schedule of the consuming module is always
        applied to the deduplicated node, irrespective of the choice of
        deduplication made by the graph preparation.

    Note:
        When two modules share a weight parameter and have different
        schedules, the schedule of the first module encountered in the
        module tree is applied. A warning is emitted for the conflict if
        there is no fake-quantize node deduplication happening (in Eager
        execution mode).

    This class manages quantization settings for an entire module, including:

    - Operation-level configurations (default, by type, by name)
    - Module-level input/output quantization
    - Module-level state (parameter) quantization

    The operation configurations follow a hierarchical precedence:

    setting quantization settings for specified tensors and ignoring op specific
    quantization capabilities. Module-level settings also don't check whether the

            quantization.
            Default: {} (empty dict, no specific module state settings)

        qat_schedule (QATSchedule | None): Optional QAT schedule for controlling
            observer and fake quantization state transitions during training.
            When set, the ``quantizer.step()`` API must be used to advance the
            schedule. See :class:`QATSchedule` for details. When None (default),
            both observer and fake quantization are enabled from the start of
            training.

        >>> # linear ops
        >>> module_config = ModuleQuantizerConfig(

    Carries the cache-update op's quantization spec inline (via ``op_quantizer_config``)
    and is the finalize-side switch that promotes the resulting fake-quant to stored
    quantization: the dequantize is relocated from the op's input to its output and
    the cache buffer is retyped to the quantized dtype.

    Used as a value in :attr:`QuantizerConfig.kv_cache_quant_configs`, which maps the
    short op-type name to a config.

    Precondition on the cache op: it must commute with quantize/dequantize —
    i.e. a pure data-movement op (slicing, narrowing, copy). Arithmetic on
    cached values would silently produce a numerically wrong model.

    During ``prepare``, the cache spec is applied as a global-only knob with
    highest priority: any prior annotation on the cache op — from any scope, by
    any mechanism (including module-scope ``op_input_spec={"*": ...}``
    wildcards) — is **hard-overridden**, not merged. A warning is emitted at
    config-construction time when explicit ``op_type_config[op]`` collisions
    are detected. See :meth:`QuantizerConfig._validate_kv_cache_quant_configs`.

    Attributes:
        op_quantizer_config: ``OpQuantizerConfig`` whose ``op_input_spec`` selects the
            input edge to quantize. The int key indexes the op's tensor-valued,
            deduplicated inputs (``node.all_input_nodes``). ``op_input_spec`` must
            contain exactly one key (no ``"*"``, no multi-key dicts) because the
            finalize-side relocation needs a single, unambiguous input edge to act on.
            ``op_output_spec`` and ``op_state_spec`` must be explicitly set to None
            (or empty); ``OpQuantizerConfig`` otherwise applies non-None defaults
            which the validator rejects.

    Example:
        >>> QuantizerConfig(
        ...     execution_mode="graph",

class QuantizerConfig(CompressionConfig[ModuleQuantizerConfig]):
    """Top-level configuration class for quantization.

    This class manages the complete quantization configuration for a neural
    network model, organizing module-level configurations in a hierarchical
    structure. It inherits from CompressionConfig and specializes it for
    quantization using ModuleQuantizerConfig.

    The configuration lookup follows a hierarchical precedence (most to least
    specific):

    1. module_name_configs - Applies to module instances matching a name
       pattern (supports regex)
    2. module_type_configs - Applies to all modules of a specific type (e.g.,
       torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear)
    3. global_config - Default configuration applied to all modules not
       otherwise configured

    Attributes:
        global_config (ModuleQuantizerConfig | None): Default module-level
            quantization configuration applied to all modules that don't have
            a more specific configuration. When QuantizerConfig is initialized
            with no arguments, a default global_config is automatically created with
            standard int8 quantization.
            Setting global_config to None disables quantization by default globally.
            Default: Auto-created with int8 quantization specs when no args
            provided

        module_type_configs (dict[str, ModuleQuantizerConfig | None] | None): Module
            type-specific configurations. Keys are fully-qualified module type
            names (e.g., "torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear",
            "torch.nn.modules.conv.Conv2d"). Values are ModuleQuantizerConfig objects or
            None to disable quantization for that module type.
            Default: {} (empty dict, no type-specific configs)

        module_name_configs (dict[str, ModuleQuantizerConfig | None] | None): Module
            name-specific configurations. Keys are module name patterns
            (supports regex matching, e.g., "model.layer1.*",
            "decoder.layers.0"). Values are ModuleQuantizerConfig objects or
            None to disable quantization for matching modules.
            Default: {} (empty dict, no name-specific configs)

        preserved_attributes (list[str] | None): Names of attributes of the model
            which should be preserved on the prepared and finalized models, even if they
            are not used in the model's forward pass.

        execution_mode (ExecutionMode | str): Specifies which quantization execution
            mode to use. Options are:

            - ExecutionMode.GRAPH / "graph":
                Graph-based quantization using ``torch.export`` and FX graphs, built on
                ``torchao``'s PT2E implementation. Requires the model to be exportable.
            - ExecutionMode.EAGER / "eager":
                Works directly on ``nn.Module`` without converting to a graph representation.
                Supports dynamic control flow (if/else, loops) and doesn't require ``torch.export``.

            Default: ExecutionMode.GRAPH

        kv_cache_quant_configs (dict[str, KVCacheQuantConfig] | None): Optional
            mapping from short op-type name (as returned by ``get_node_type``,
            to the cache-update op's ``KVCacheQuantConfig``. Each entry enables
            storing the corresponding KV-cache buffer in a quantized dtype: it
            carries the op's ``OpQuantizerConfig`` inline and triggers a finalize-side
            rewrite that relocates the dequantize from the op's input to its
            output. Graph mode only; rejected for eager mode by
            :meth:`_validate_kv_cache_quant_configs`. See
            :class:`KVCacheQuantConfig` for details.
            Default: None (no KV-cache buffer quantization)

    Example:
        >>> # Create default quantizer config (auto-creates int8 global
        >>> # config)
        >>> config = QuantizerConfig()
        >>> # config.global_config is automatically created with default int8 specs
        >>>
        >>> # Disable quantization globally
        >>> config = QuantizerConfig(
        ...     global_config=None
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Create custom quantizer config with type-specific settings for Linear
        >>> # modules.
        >>> config = QuantizerConfig(
        ...     # Omitted global_config section defaults to int8/int8 weight/activation
        ...     # quantization for all operations
        ...     module_type_configs={
        ...         "torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear": ModuleQuantizerConfig(
        ...             op_input_spec={
        ...                 0: ...
        ...             },
        ...             op_output_spec={
        ...                 0: ...
        ...             },
        ...             op_state_spec={
        ...                 'weight': ...
        ...             }
        ...         )
        ...     },
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Load quantizer config from YAML file
        >>> config = QuantizerConfig.from_yaml("config.yaml")

    Notes:
        - When initialized with no arguments, a default configuration is
          created with int8 symmetric quantization for activations and
          weights
        - The from_yaml class method provides an alternative way to create
          configurations from YAML files
        - Setting a config to None explicitly disables quantization for that
          scope
        - More specific configurations (name > type > global) always override
          less specific ones
